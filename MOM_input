                                ! Determines how to specify the coordinate resolution. Valid options are:
                                !  PARAM       - use the vector-parameter ALE_RESOLUTION
                                !  UNIFORM[:N] - uniformly distributed
                                !  FILE:string - read from a file. The string specifies
